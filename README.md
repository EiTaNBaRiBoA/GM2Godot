# GM2Godot

GM2Godot is a tool which converts GameMaker (2024.6.2) projects to Godot (4.2) projects.
This repository is work in progress and I'll slowly add Contributing.MD, issues, branches and milestones.
Feel free to help!

The program requires the Pillow library to use
```
pip install Pillow
```
